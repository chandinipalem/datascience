## Installing and Creating Jupyter Notebook
pip install notebook 
To run the notebook: jupyter notebook

To Install via homebrew: brew install jupyterlab

Jupyter Notebook offers a simplified, lightweight notebook authoring experience. It allows you to develop own extensions or applications on top of existing Jupyter software.

To Create or Open a jupyter notebook via VS Code: 
1. Run the "Create: New Jupyter Notebook" command from the Command Palette (Command + Shift + P) or create a new .ipynb file in the project workspace.
2. Select a kernel using the kernel picker in the top right.
3. Then, the language picker, located in the bottom right of each code cell, should automatically update to the language supported by the kernel.
You can open an existing jupyter notebook by right clicking on it and clicking "open in VS Code". Now you can run your notebook in VS Code as a whole or break it up into cells and run each cell individually. 



## Installation

Use `pip`:

```
pip install datascience
```
